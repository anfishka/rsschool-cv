###About Myself:

The main reason why I started learnimg web developing is feeling like you've gotten absolutely nothing. I worked as a salesperson, childminder, florist and I'd understood it isn't my goal. My goal is BECOME a really good specialist in IT sphere, using all of my skills and habits, and of course learn and develop everytime for the better future of our world. Now I'm about to get my hands on Javascript as I'm getting used to coding with HTML and CSS. I got Windows and code on VS Code. So far, I'm practicing with just making random websites on my local server, getting more used to imrove my skills in JS and HTML & CSS.

###Skills and Proficiency:

*HTML5() CSS3
*JavaScript Basics
*Git, Github
*VS Code, Sublime, IntelliJ IDEA

###Code example:
**KATA from CODEWARS:**_Write a function that will take a key of X and place it in the middle of Y repeated N times.

Extra challege (not tested): You can complete this with under 70 characters without using regex. Challenge yourself to do this. It wont be best practices but it will work.

Rules:

If X cannot be placed in the middle, return X.

N will always be > 0._
```function middleMe(N, X, Y) {
  let strOfElem = [];
  if (N === 0) {
    return X;
  }
  if (N % 2 === 0) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
      strOfElem.push(Y);
      if (N / 2 === strOfElem.length) {
        strOfElem.push(X);
      }
    }
    return strOfElem.join("");
  } else {
    return X;
  }
}```
