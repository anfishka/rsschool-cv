### About Myself:

The main reason why I started learning web developing is feeling like you've got absolutely nothing. I've worked as a salesperson, childminder, florist and realized that it wasn't my goal. My goal is to BECOME a really good specialist in IT sphere, using all of my skills and knowledge, and of course learn and develop everytime for the better future of our world. Now I'm about to get my hands on Javascript as I'm getting used to coding with HTML and CSS. I have got Windows and coded on VS Code. So far, I'm practicing with just making random websites on my local server, imroving my skills in JS and HTML & CSS.

### Code example:

**KATA from CODEWARS:**_Write a function that will take a key of X and place it in the middle of Y repeated N times.

Extra challege (not tested): You can complete this with under 70 characters without using regex. Challenge yourself to do this. It wont be best practices but it will work.

Rules:

If X cannot be placed in the middle, return X.

N will always be > 0._

```function middleMe(N, X, Y) {
  let strOfElem = [];
  if (N === 0) {
    return X;
  }
  if (N % 2 === 0) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
      strOfElem.push(Y);
      if (N / 2 === strOfElem.length) {
        strOfElem.push(X);
      }
    }
    return strOfElem.join("");
  } else {
    return X;
  }
}
```
